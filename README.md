# ALL IN ONE

A working full-stack application, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet (most likely Heroku)
A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your GitHub repo
A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc
Wireframes of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
an ERD diagram of your DB (this can be a photo of a piece of paper)
A link in your readme.md to the publically-accessible user stories you created

## Approach
		Plan,Trial,Incorporate
		Planning stage took about 2 days. Coming up with an idea, wire framing, and creating Tables for the data.
		Data management was the most difficult part of this project. As you will need to see what is necessary and what wasn't.

		Trial 
		Taking data and functions testing them within the local host to ensure it works well with each other. Keeping track which controller is talking to which model. This is an extremely important part for me during my project.

		Incorporate
		When i completed each trial or milestone i had to merge with things that are already in my code. This took a long while as there will be bugs alone the way

## Unsolved Problems
		There are some parts in my app that i still wish to change and improve on.
		1. To be able to complete workouts
		2. To be able to set a data requirement in the models that deal with dates.
