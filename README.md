## Approach
		Plan,Trial,Incorporate
		Planning stage took about 2 days. Coming up with an idea, wire framing, and creating Tables for the data.
		Data management was the most difficult part of this project. As you will need to see what is necessary and what wasn't.

		Trial 
		Taking data and functions testing them within the local host to ensure it works well with each other. Keeping track which controller is talking to which model. This is an extremely important part for me during my project.

		Incorporate
		When i completed each trial or milestone i had to merge with things that are already in my code. This took a long while as there will be bugs alone the way

## Unsolved Problems
		There are some parts in my app that i still wish to change and improve on.
		1. To be able to complete workouts
		2. To be able to set a data requirement in the models that deal with dates.
